## Version info ##

Users on Windows who want to record PC Engine / TurboGrafx-16 movies should use [PCEjin](http://code.google.com/p/pcejin/)

PCEjin is sync compatible with Mednafen but provides a much smoother experience in Windows.

The latest SVN of Mednafen is able to play PCEjin movies, but it cannot play older mcm or play/record anything except PCE.  Due to a slight change in the movie format earlier mc2 movies are now incompatible with both pcejin and the latest Mednafen SVN.  mcm-mc2 also creates movies that are incorrect for the latest versions.  To fix this, buttons 1 and 2 must be swapped in the movie file, since the earlier versions had these two buttons incorrectly reversed.

If you want to make a movie for other platforms get **mednafen-rr-1.1-win32.zip** for Windows, or on Linux, check out and compile [r144](https://code.google.com/p/mednafen-rr/source/detail?r=144).
