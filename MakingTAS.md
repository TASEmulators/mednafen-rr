Windows Users:
Mednafen is command line only.  This can be cumbersome but there are some options.

# Configuring mednafen commandline properties #

Mednafen-Front is packaged with mednafen to make it easier to use mednafen-rr via commandline.  For more details see [MednafenFront](MednafenFront.md).

To start a movie, specify a movie file in the Movie field of the Movie Tab.  Then specify a Rom name in the Rom field of the General tab and click launch mednafen.

### Alternate methods ###
Another method is to create a shortcut to mednafen then right-click the shortcut and go to properties.  Add the commandline options to the target line.

Another option is to download Let's Mednafen:

However, it does not have movie making options.

Load up lmednafen, then set up your window settings.
Then in the "other command-line" box, add -mov [yourmoviename](yourmoviename.md)

This will load your movie into memory when mednafen loads (or create one if it doesn't exist).  Then go to File > Loading files to select your game.
