# Overview #

Mednafen-Front allows the user to browse for files such as ROM, Movie files, and savestates, as well as select movie options such as Read-only.  It then translates these into commandline options to feed into mednafen.

# Using Mednafen-Front #

## Controls ##

### Launch Mednafen/Close Mednafen ###
This button will open mednafen.exe.  If it is already open, it will close it.  In order to launch mednafen, a valid ROM name must be specified.  In addition, the commandline length must not exceed 255 characters.

### Commandline ###

Allows the user to see the resulting commandline generated by Mednafen-Front.

The length field shows the number of characters in the commandline.  Windows does not support more than 255 characters in a commandline.

The update button updates the commandline with the most recent settings.

## General Tab ##

Rom - Allows the user specify a ROM to load into mednafen.  This must be specified in order to launch mednafen.

Loadstate - Specifies a savestate to load when mednafen begins.  **Warning: This should not be used in conjunction with Movie files.  Doing so can cause corrupted files.**

Pause - Specifies mednafen's initial pause state.  Check means it will be paused on startup.

Other commands - Any additional commandline options not available in Mednafen front can be added here.  [here](http://code.google.com/p/mednafen-rr/|See) for more details on additional commandline options.

## Movie Tab ##

Movie - specifies the movie mednafen will use when loaded.

Author - This will store the author's name into the specified movie file. **Must not contain spaces!** This only needs to be done once, since it will be stored into the file.

Play Movie - specifies to begin playback of the specified movie on mednafen startup

Record Movie - specifies to begin recording the specified movie on startup.  Careful, this will destroy a pre-existing movie.

Read-only - specifies mednafen's movie read-only status.

## Settings ##

Close mednafen on exit - If checked, closing Mednafen-Front will automatically close mednafen as well.

Auto-load - If checked, Mednafen-Front will automatically open mednafen on start-up

Directory Overrides

Currently the only option is an override for mednafen.exe.  By default, it will look for mednafen.exe in the same folder as Mednafen-Front.exe.  Use this field to specify an alternate location.
